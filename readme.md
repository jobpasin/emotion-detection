# Facial Recognition Detection

## Goal & Algorithm
Our project aims to create a real-time emotion detection using machine learning algorithms. 
Our detection consists of two steps:
* Face detection using Haar features on openCV. (Currently not in the repo, will be updated soon) 
* Emotion detection based on eigenface algorithm. We create our own function in this step
